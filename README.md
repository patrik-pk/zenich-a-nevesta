## Overview
This is one of my first website that I have written. I did it as my high school project in a subject called "Practice Companies, where we made our own unofficial companies. So I took charge of the website.

The project is written in HTML5, CSS3 (SASS), some jQuery and little PHP7 (mail function, includes).

I had to rewrite a lot of the website as my skills got better as the time went. Even these days I would do a lot of stuff different way, e.g. mobile-first (there are a lots of media queries). But I spent a lot of time on this project so it's time to move on and let it be as it is.
